## How It Works
This calculator helps you determine the optimal position size for your trades based on your risk management parameters:
- **Enter your total account value**
- **Set your entry price and stop loss**
- **Adjust your risk percentage** (range: 0.1% to 100%)
- **View calculated position size and profit targets**

---

## Risk Management
The calculator uses the difference between your **entry price** and **stop loss** to determine your **risk per share**. It then calculates the maximum number of shares you can purchase while staying within your chosen risk percentage.

---

## Profit Targets
Profit targets are calculated at various **risk-to-reward ratios** (2:1 to 6:1) based on your initial risk. These targets can help you plan your exit strategies for profitable trades.

**Note:** Always conduct your own research and never risk more than you can afford to lose. This tool is designed to assist with position sizing, not to provide financial advice.
